# Gomoku-Bot
A Gobang program with a built-in AI. 

Currently there's a functioning Gobang game and two versions of painfully slow mini-max algorithm with a depth of 4.

# Algorithm list:

## Minimax:
With two functions maximizer() and minimizer(),

calling the maximizer or the minimizer will call the other one recursively until designated depth reached.

Alpha-beta pruning is included.

# Notes
More algorithms will be implemented in the future.
